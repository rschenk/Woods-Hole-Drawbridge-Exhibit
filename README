== Woods Hole Drawbridge Project

The town of Woods Hole has a quasi-famous drawbridge. The old bridge was installed in 1938, and replaced this winter (2008-2009). The former bridge tender salvaged some of the more interesting parts of the bridge while it was being demolished, including the control box. 

This is a Flash animation for the Woods Hole Historical Museum that interfaces with the control box, and allows kids to "play bridge tender".
